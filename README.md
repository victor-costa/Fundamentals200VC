# Welcome to GitHub Copilot Fundamentals 200!
A repository for all things GitHub Copilot Training - Fundamentals 200!

The GitHub Copilot Fundamentals 200 Workshop is designed for developers who want to advanced knowledge and enhanced skills in using GitHub Copilot. 

## Please check out this [lab guide](https://experience.cloudlabs.ai/#/labguidepreview/b24dc63a-29e6-4a26-9f95-4737c8465a34) to follow-along and complete the self-paced labs.
*_please note that this lab handout focuses on the use of a VM, rather than using a VM, you will be using your own GitHub account, GitHub Copilot license, and IDE as well as this GitHub repository_

## Some Tips:
- Start with Lab 01: Task 2!
- You will be using your own GitHub account, don't worry about logging in using VM credentials (you don't have one!)
- Don't worry about saving files into the **CloudLabs** folder
- You are not required to validate _any_ of your labs! No need to navigate to a **Lab Validation page** (you don't have one!)
